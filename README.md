# Movies-Analysis
This project is to analyze a Movies Dataset about ratings and movie information

* Tools: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
* Dataset: `movies.csv`

1. Create a data model (conceptual data model is mandatory, logical, and physical data model
is a plus).

| **Feature** | **Description**                                        | **Relationships**                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MOVIES`    | Movie title                                            | **Primary identifier** of a movie. Related to year, genre, stars, rating, runtime, etc.               |
| `YEAR`      | Year of release (can be a range or "2021â€“")            | **1:1** with a movie (each movie has one certain year of release/range)                                   |
| `GENRE`     | Comma-separated genres                                 | **Many-to-Many** with movies (a movie can have multiple genres; a genre can apply to multiple movies) |
| `RATING`    | IMDb rating                                            | **1:1** with a movie                                                                                  |
| `ONE-LINE`  | Short synopsis                                         | **1:1** with a movie                                                                                  |
| `STARS`     | Includes director(s) and actor(s) in one string        | **Many-to-Many** with movies through roles (director, actor). Must be **split**.                      |
| `VOTES`     | Number of user ratings                                 | **1:1** with a movie, part of the `Rating` entity                                                     |
| `RunTime`   | Duration in minutes                                    | **1:1** with a movie                                                                                  |
| `Gross`     | Box office gross                                       | **1:1** with a movie (may be missing (null) for many entries)                                             |

2. Create a database based on the data model that has been created

    SQL Code: `2. Database Creation.sql`

4. Create an ETL script to import the movies.csv dataset into the created database

    SQL Code: `3. ETL Script.sql`

5. Create a query to display:

    a. Number of unique film titles

      ![a](Unique-film-count.png)

    b. Film Title, Year of Release, and Rating of the film starring Lena Headey Sort By Year of Release.
      ![b](Lena-Headey-Films.png)

    c. The name of the director and total gross of the films that have been directed.
      ![c](Director_and_Total_Gross.png)

    d. Film Title, Year of Release, and Rating of 5 films that have comedy genre with the largest gross
      ![d](Top_5_Comedy_Films_by_Gross.png)

    e. Film Title, Year of Release and Rating of the film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro
